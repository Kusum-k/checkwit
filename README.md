![Image Generation App](https://i.ibb.co/p0f27C2/Thumbnail-9.png)

CheckWit is a full-stack AI-powered web app that generates high-quality images from natural language prompts. Built with the MERN stack and OpenAIâ€™s DALLÂ·E API, users can create, view, and share generated art through a sleek, responsive interface.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

| Layer     | Tech                         |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS  |
| Backend   | Node.js + Express.js         |
| Database  | MongoDB (Atlas)              |
| AI Model  | OpenAI (DALLÂ·E API)          |
| Hosting   | Vercel & Render              |

##  How It Works

1. User enters a **text prompt**  
2. Frontend sends the prompt to backend via REST API  
3. Backend uses **OpenAI API** to generate a base64 image  
4. The image is displayed instantly and can be shared to the community gallery  
5. All shared posts are saved in **MongoDB** and shown on the homepage
